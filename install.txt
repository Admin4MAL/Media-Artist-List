These instructions assume you are installing on a Linux server, but downloading the installation to a desktop type machine.  It works for me with the latest version of Vortexbox. 

Down load the zip file from GitHub.
Extract the content from the archive to your home area.
Copy or move the folder structure you extracted to an accessible area on your Vortexbox server, such as the files share
Logon on to the vortexbox by which ever means you would do that as root.
change to the folder with the name you copied across:
    "cd/storage/Media-Artist-List-master".
change the permissions on the installation script "MAL_install.sh" so that it is executable:
    chmod 700 MAL_install.sh
execute the installation script:
    ./MAL_install.sh

The installation will install the php-pdo library which enables PHP to read the SQLite database, it is possible you have already have this install. If that is the case the installation my display "Nothing to do." and "Complete", this relates only to that library, It doesn't suggest the other files haven't been copied accross unless you get other error message.

While you are still at the command prompt run the following command to find the IP adress of your server, unless you already know it (the capitalisation of I makes a difference):
hostname -I 

You can then log off as root and go back to your Desktop machine.
Load your prefered browser and  in the address bar type the following replacing the IP address below with the address of your server:
    http://192.168.1.24/MAL_start.php

When you have the page displayed save it as a favorite to enable easy access.


If you have set up an LMS server of your own, under any other OS I guess you will be able to adapt these instructions.

Basically the installation places the file "MAL_start.php" and the folder MAL (which contains the rest of the applications files) within the the default root folder of the web server, which is commonly "/var/www/html".
